How to conduct comparative Analysis of Axion Biosystems spike detection with the ‎neuralMetrics-Tool and DrCell:‎Critical Note: Ensure consistent utilization of experiment date data for both DrCell and the ‎generated *_neuralMetrics file.‎‎1) Utilizing DrCell:‎‎   - Execute Automated Analysis for converted RAW-Control and RAW-LSD data.‎‎   - Exercise discretion in selecting the SWTTEO algorithm for spike detection.‎‎   - Conduct a comprehensive search for both positive and negative spikes.‎‎   - Preserve the output by saving it in the designated _TS folder.‎‎2) Processing the _TS (or, if the SWTEO algorithm is employed: _TS_SWTEO) file:‎‎   - Run the findSpikes_DrCell.m script.‎‎   --> Generates two .csv files that encapsulate the summation of spikes for each well ‎corresponding to the distinct treatments (control/lsd).‎‎3) Employing the *_neuralMetrics file:‎‎   - Execute the findSpikes_neuralMetrics.m script.‎‎   --> Stores the output in a dedicated folder with two accompanying .csv files, elucidating the ‎sum of spikes for each well under each treatment condition (control/lsd).‎‎4) Execute the compareSpikeDetection.m script:‎‎   - Undertakes a comparative analysis of the sum of spikes detected using the neuralMetrics-‎Tool against DrCell, represented in a line diagram.‎‎   - Establishes a folder named after the date of the experiment to collate relevant data.‎‎   --> Preserves the results in a .pdf file featuring the comparative figure.‎
