First step for all codes: Run spikesAxion.m â€“ The code creates a .csv file with all wells in the header, the date the experiment was conducted, and the number of spikes given in the files.

For Synchrony plot:
- Run extractSynchrony.m to create line plots with error bars for the synchrony metrics Area Under Normalized Cross-Correlation.

For Boxplots: 
- Load the .csv file in createBoxplots.m and give the starting date (= first day after plating). You will get a boxplot with the Number of spikes on the y-axis and the days in vitro on the x-axis (saved as .pdf file).

For Bar charts with error bars:

- Run createBarCharts.m and give the start day as input.

For Bar charts with error bars comparing Bicuculline and Sham control data:

- Run exractBicuSham.m and save the .csv file and extract the NumberofSpikes for Bicuculline and Sham control data in two different .csv files. ! Please note: The data expects an exact time interval that needs to be adjusted, same for the wells for the data. The NumberofSpikes are normalized to the data recordings on day 1.
- Run createBarChartBicu.m to create Bar charts with error bars for Bicuculline and Sham control data, plotting each next to each other for each recording time.
